The first thing that comes to my mind when tone is in question is the age old discussion: Fender Stratocaster or Gibson Les Paul. There is hardly anything more powerful to tone shaping than the distint contrasts these two legends bring to the table. This view can also lend itself when player comparison is made.
Another big contribution to how your favorite Axe slinger defines his or her tone is in the amplification method chosen. A powerful but clean over drive that can really enhance the tone... or power monster with tubes screaming while displays of Earth shattering acrobats take place. 
The outside influences.... (and there are so many that this list could go on forever) really play a role in the shape a tone develops, but the real magic... what separates the mere mortals that only dream about the glory attained by the heros of my story; "It's all in the hands Stan." More so the fingers. Gods of Tone have it dripping out of their magnificent fingers. So much so that even though my prior point of how the guitar impacts tone, for instance: Stevie Ray Vaughan would sound like Stevie Ray Vaughan playing a piece of driftwood with fishing line tied to it.... haha... okay... little extreme but his fingers where that powerful.
